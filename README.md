Improving Photometric Redshifts Using Large-Scale Structure and Neural Networks
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach to improving photometric redshifts by integrating large-scale structure (LSS) data and advanced neural network architectures. Photometric redshift estimation is a crucial task in cosmology and astrophysics, enabling the determination of distances to galaxies based on their photometric data. Our method leverages the spatial correlations in the LSS and the powerful feature extraction capabilities of neural networks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of these estimates.
